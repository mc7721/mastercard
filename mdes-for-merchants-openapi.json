All request and response payloads are sent in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data-interchange format. Each endpoint in the API specifies the HTTP Method used to access it. All strings in request and response objects are to be UTF-8 encoded.  Each API URI includes the major and minor version of API that it conforms to.  This will allow multiple concurrent versions of the API to be deployed simultaneously.\n<br>\n__Authentication__\nMastercard uses OAuth 1.0a with body hash extension for authenticating the API clients. This requires every request that you send to \nMastercard to be signed with an RSA private key. A private-public RSA key pair must be generated consisting of: <br>\n1 .
